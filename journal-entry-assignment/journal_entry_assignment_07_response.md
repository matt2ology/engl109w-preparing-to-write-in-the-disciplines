## BACKGROUND

### 1 Choose an example appeared in Food Inc. Clearly explain what happened (Who, When, Where, How) to introduce the topic of your proposal

Who: Vince Edwards – Tyson Grower
When: 2008
Where: Kentucky
How: After multiple visits by Tyson representatives Vince stopped showing the inner workings of his farm Tyson operation

### 2 Why is there a need to address this problem? How does the problem affect you and your community?

The problem is having industrial companies suppressing and intimidating farmers
from providing insight to how our food is raised/produced; as a result, we are
ignorant to both human and animal welfare, if our food is produced to a health
safety standard, and if worker safety regulations are upheld/meet.

### 3 Who is you intended audience of your proposal? Why do you think your intended audience should care about the problem? Why do you think they can help you solve the problem?

The intended audience would be a general reader who does not have any previous
insight nor have they had the thought past their minds as to the ethics of
producing chickens in a particular condition, the workers who are involved, and
big corporation business practices onto their farms and farmers.

## CAUSE OF THE PROBLEM

### 4 Based on what you’ve learned and researched, which cause seems most reasonable to you as contributing significantly to the problem? In what ways might it contribute to the problem?

The biggest problem is that our food production are largely produced of major
corporations, that with the ability to scale, mass produce, and with influence
of capital influence lawmakers to instantiate both policy and laws to reduce
local, small to medium farms, less competitive to the farms like Tyson owns.

## EFFECT OF THE PROBLEM

### 5 Why does the problem potentially affect a number of people? What would be the immediate and long-term impact if no solution is offered?

The problem with the consolidation, less competition in the industry/market,
a majority of farms are under the big corporations, the lack of small to medium
independent farms are that:

1. If an outbreak of any particular contamination or diseases it would infect
the whole operation of said farm; as a result, of the top 3 chicken farms
(Tyson, JBS, Cargill) we would lose a significant amount of products on grocery
shelves.

## SOLUTION

### 6 What is your solution? Why do you think your solution will be successful (Be specific about the rationale of your solution)? Why do you think your solution is more practical and effective than other solutions?

The solution is to fully enforce anti-competition policy and laws; in addition,
so as long there isn't any violation of a farm/company intellectual property
farms must allow third-party inspection of their farms to allow a standardized
assessment and ranking as to if they are meeting both health and labor safety standards.

## ACTION PLAN

### 7 For this solution to work effectively, what’s your specific plan to implement it? What would you like your intended readers to do to make your solution a reality? What are the steps to bring about the change
