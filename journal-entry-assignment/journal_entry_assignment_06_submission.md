Research and development in agricultural robotics: A perspective of digital farming. International Journal of Agricultural and Biological Engineering. 11. 1-14. 10.25165/j.ijabe.20181104.4278. 
   1. Digital farming is the practice of modern technologies such as sensors, robotics, and data analysis for shifting from tedious operations to continuously automated processes. The paper reviews some of the latest achievements in agricultural robotics, specifically those that are used for autonomous weed control, field scouting, and harvesting.
   2. This is useful for it provides latest developments to how farming is becoming more digital
   3. Cool technologies are used to interface with our "analog world" and capture/manipulate them by ones and zeros

   1. Constraint to farmers’ adoption of digital technologies, beyond costs, relevance, user-friendliness, human capital requirements, and perceived technology risks, is farmers’ lack of trust in digital technologies
   2. This provides insight to how technlology may seem invasive and distrustful to farmers
   3. This is valid for companies like Green Deere tend to make their equipment Proprietary leaving farmers no way to have their equipment fixed without an offical support staff/equipment from Green Deere themeselves

   1. Agricultural data and their use for better decision-making and innovation are at the core of the digital transformation of agriculture. But fragmented and unclear data governance arrangements may weaken farmers’ willingness to adopt digital solutions.
   2. Insight to how governments and policies influence the adoptiation of state-of-the-art technologies and makes farmers more acceptiable to the fears of intergrating new technology into the industry and business
   3. Farmers, like us all, should have rights to our own data and how others may use it
