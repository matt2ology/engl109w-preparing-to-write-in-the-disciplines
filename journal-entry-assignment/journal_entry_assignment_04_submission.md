Based on what you’ve learned from Food Inc. so far, which issue/social problem
(factory farming, food safety, or low-income families and limited healthy food
options) interests you? Read the background information section related to your
interest (Chapter 1, 3, or 4) in the file entitled “Food Inc. Study Guide” and
answer the following questions

The issue/social problem that interest me most is the topic on factory farming.

## Which example/scene from Food Inc. can you use to help you explain the issue/problem? What’s the worst part about it?

The example/scene from Food Inc. that can be used to help me explain the
issue/problem is the when they tell us how vertically integrated these food
companies are from the supply of baby chicks, to the immunization, the
transportation, the saluter, and packaging are all done "in-house".

The worst part, of many, about factory farming is that there are fewer
independently owned farms. If one of the major factory farms experience
contamination in their production line, have to evoke market wide recalls,
a significant percentage of market shelves would be void of said product.

## Why do you care about the issue/problem? How does the problem affect you and your community?

I care about this issue/problem because factory farming encompasses a lot of
my interests that include (but not limited to) logistics, optimizations,
standards and regulations, and automation.

Factory farming affect me and my community by controlling what goes into the
food; for example, the amount of antibiotics and chemicals introduced during
the life of animal, and/or salts and sugars added during the processing.

## Who can help you solve the problem? Why should they care about the problem?

We ourselves can help solve this problem by changing market demand to more
local and independent farming operations and by law/policy changes.

We should care about this problem for we either allow companies dictate what
goes into our food ignoring health and safety conflicts because they make
profit regardless, or we can have a say to what goes into our food and
be more ethical to how we treat the people in the industry and be more
humane to the animals that become our food.
