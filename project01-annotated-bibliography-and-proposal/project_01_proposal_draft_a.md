## 1) Choose a topic/issue presented in Food Inc

> Industrial, factory, farming

### I think the most important idea (or the most interesting idea) about my topic is

> The unintended consequences of industrial farming and the risk presented to
> the population.

### Four specific points that support the most important idea about this topic are

#### Point A

> Contaminated food lead to food poisoning or death

#### Point B

> Effectiveness of antibiotics are less effective: "antibiotic resistance" strains

#### Point C

> Factory farming elevate the risk of pandemic diseases

### My thesis statement is

> The most interesting topic of industrial farming is the unintentional risk
> presented to the population.

## 2) Write a mini annotated bibliography

### Point A (set up argument)

> Contaminated food lead to food poisoning or death. While most E. coli are
> beneficial and help to break down food in the process of digestion, certain
> strains can cause serious infection, severe stomach cramps, bloody diarrhea,
> kidney failure, and even death; as a result, meat packers use ammonia to
> "cleanse" meat for human consumption.

#### Point A Citation

Comparison of bacterial communities in faeces of beef cattle fed diets containing corn and wet distillers' grain with solubles.

    solubles,” Letters in Applied Microbiology, vol. 55, no. 2, pp. 109–114, 2012.
```

#### Point A Quote

```text
Significance and Impact of the Study: It is known that a diet of 40% corn-based
wet distillers' grains with solubles (WDGS) increases the generic Escherichia
coli in the faeces and enriches E. coli O157:H7. The results from the current
study suggest that in addition to previously observed changes in E. coli, the
entire bacterial community structure is different for animals fed 40% corn-based
WDGS compared to a traditional corn-finishing diet.
```

### Point B (set up argument)

> Effectiveness of antibiotics are less effective: "antibiotic resistance" strains
> as a result of over use of antibiotics administered to the animals.

### Point B Citation

Antibiotic Abuse in Animal Agriculture: Exacerbating Drug Resistance in Human Pathogens.

    Risk Assessment: An International Journal, vol. 10, no. 1, pp. 121–134, 2004.
```

#### Point B Quote

```text
Most of the antibiotics produced in the U.S. are fed to farm animals routinely
as "growth promoters," and to facilitate "factory farming." Unfortunately,
this places selective pressure on bacteria to develop antibiotic-resistance.
```

### Point C (set up argument)

> Factory farming elevate the risk of pandemic diseases as a result of keeping
> a particular livestock (cattle, poultry, fish, ect.) at large scale; for this
> reason, any specie specific sickness has multiple vector points to jump from
> and a possibility to mutate to contaminate humans as well.

### Point C Citation

Experimental infection of highly and low pathogenic avian influenza viruses to chickens, ducks, tree sparrows, jungle crows, and black rats for the evaluation of their roles in virus transmission.

    of their roles in virus transmission,” Veterinary Microbiology, vol. 182, pp. 108–115, 2016. 
```

#### Point C Quote

```text
chickens, ducks, sparrows, and crows were highly susceptible to HPAIV infection.
Significant titers of virus were recovered from the sparrows and crows infected
with HPAIVs, which suggests that they potentially play roles of transmission of
HPAIVs to poultry.

## RHETORICAL ANALYSIS FOR PROJECT#1

(After you read the content in Project #1 Instruction Sheet, answer the questions below.)

### ABOUT THE WRITER/ETHOS

#### What is my purpose of writing this project? What should be this project’s main idea?

> My purpose of writing this project, main idea, is to present the unintended
> consequences of industrial farming and the risk presented to the population.

#### How should I present myself in my writing? Which part of my identity should I present in this project? What voice, word choice, tone and appropriate language should I focus on?

> In writing I should present myself as a "messenger of facts", not to be a
> storyteller, but to only break down what is said in the academic journal; so,
> the reader may understand, in following the logical deductions and reasoning,
> why I argue a particular point in the essay.
>
> In this project I shall identify as an academic writer.
>
> While writing I should should focus on writing with accuracy, logical
> presentation, and emotional neutrality.

#### How can I show myself as trustworthy and credible in my writing? What research activities should I do to improve my credibility to discuss the subject of this project?

> To show myself as a trustworthy and creditable writer I should not mix in my
> personal feelings, state only the fact, and make logical deductions based on
> the facts and data presented along with citations.
>
> To improve my credibility to discuss the subject of this project is to gather
> as much information, checking if other creditable resources agree or disagree
> with the findings, and derive arguments on sources that has been vetted by
> other creditable resources and individuals.

### ABOUT THE READER/PATHOS

#### Who is the intended reader?

> The intended reader are those who aware that no business of any industry
> are free of posing harm and risk to the employees, environment, and/or the
> community; although, laws, policies, and government institutes are established
> to protect against intentional harm the reader may not be aware of the
> accidental side effects of the solutions implemented.

#### What prior knowledge or background information does the reader need?

> At a high level the reader needs to know that one people can become infected
> with E. coli by consuming foods or beverages, high concentrations of E. coli in
> beef are a result of corn fed cows, to clean our beef products ammonia is used;
> two antibiotics inhibits the growth of or destroys bacteria, bacteria that are
> not killed by antibiotics carry that trait to the next generation of bacteria
> and become antibiotic resistant, because antibiotics does not kill the bacteria
> they persist in our food processing line; and three factory farming keeps a
> mass of a particular livestock, because there are so many cows (for example),
> any cow diseases may rapidly populate, mutate to infect humans, and become
> ground zero of an outbreak.

#### How should I encourage the reader to adopt my points? How can I make my analysis more interesting and useful to the reader? What research activities should I do to achieve this goal?

> I should encourage the reader to adopt my points by presenting an objective
> standpoint on my topic, free of subjective personal opinions, and only argue
> on metrics and factual statements presented.
>
> I can make my analysis more interesting and useful to the reader by making a
> call-to-action where one may be encouraged to write to their congress person,
> vote in an upcoming election, or deny a company of their dollar vote.
>
> A few research activities I can do to is to look into recent developments on my
> topic and highlight if there is a particular proposition to vote on, which
> members of congress one may write to advocate for a particular notion, and
> search if local communities one may join to help fight for the cause.

### ABOUT THE TEXT/LOGOS

#### Which academic writing genre(s) is required for this project?

> This project may require one to be able to write in an analytical style.

#### What expectations does the reader have for this type of genre? What should be the appropriate and effective writing organization and format for this project?

> The two genres, analytical and critical, the reader should expect that I, the
> author, should be able to re-organize the facts and information to describe
> parts, types, and/or the relationships of each idea
>
> An appropriate and effective writing organization and format for this project
> should be that of a typical essay where an introduction of a topic, a body
> of arguments, and a conclusion where no new information are presented and a
> possible call-to-action is proposed.

#### What major points/reasons should I present for this project? What evidence should I use to support my points/reasons? What research activities should I do to collect sufficient and convincing evidence?

> The major points I should present for this project is the unintended
> consequences of industrial farming and the risk presented to the population;
> for, contaminated food lead to food poisoning or death, effectiveness of
> antibiotics are less effective leading to more antibiotic resistant bacteria
> strains, and factory farming elevate the risk of pandemic diseases.
>
> The evidence to support my major points are: contaminated food lead to food
> poisoning or death, effectiveness of antibiotics are less effective leading
> to more antibiotic resistant bacteria strains, and factory farming elevate
> the risk of pandemic diseases.
>
> Research activities that I should do to collect sufficient and convincing
> evidence is to sort though recent, within the past 5 years, academic journals
> to extrapolate reliable, tested, and vetted information of a particular
> topic. I am to avoid periodical for they are at times subjective, and don't
> have all the information or have inaccuracies; but, that isn't to argue to
> never use them for they may provide insight to social feelings and mood on
> a matter and is useful to articulate if the public is in favor for or against
> the status quo.
