Based on what youâ€™ve learned from the past two weeks, answer the questions below:

## 1. What course material or writing theories/concepts/skills/strategies did you find useful/effective? Why?

The course strategy I found useful is rhetorical analysis of
"Don't Blame the Eater"; for, it encourages one to actively engage with the text.

Forces the reader to apply critical analysis, reasoning, and abstract core key
ideas and concepts the author is arguing for in the passage.

## 2. What did you find confusing/difficult? Why?

I didn't find the strategy nor the assignments confusing.

Actively engaging with reading material the reader has the opportunity to
make connections with arguments previous, derive insight from other media the
reader has consumed, and from new arguments for or against what the author has
presented.

## 3. Any questions or suggestions?

I have no further questions.
