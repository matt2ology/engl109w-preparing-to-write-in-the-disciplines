Based on what youâ€™ve learned from the past two weeks, answer the questions below:

## 1. What course material or writing theories/concepts/skills/strategies did you find useful/effective? Why?

Your pointers on the basics of resume writing are useful and appreciated; for, too many times when
reviewing other student's resume they don't follow any form or structure, nor do they abide by
expected standards that companies and organizations look for in a resume.

It's all too frustrating to resumes read as if they are the job requirements listed on the job page of the employer:
that they work there without making an impact or generated any results.

## 2. What did you find confusing/difficult? Why?
