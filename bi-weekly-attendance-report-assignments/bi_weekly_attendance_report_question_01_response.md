Based on what you’ve learned from the past two weeks, answer the questions below:

## 1. What course material or writing theories/concepts/skills/strategies did you find useful/effective? Why?

I found the reading comprehension SQ3R method to be very useful, for it
encourages the reader to actively engage with the text. SQ3R is a mnemonic for
each step in the critical reading process and they instruct the reader to
survey, question, read, recite, and review.

## 2. What did you find confusing/difficult? Why?

I didn’t find anything confusing or difficult about the SQ3R critical reading
method; for, each step in the process is straightforward:

1. Survey: Lock over the text/passage to establish its purpose and main idea
2. Question: Write questions to give purpose and improve concentration
3. Read: Search for answers to questions
4. Recite: Recite to help put the information into long-term memory
5. Review: Review the material to understand and remember.

## 3. Any questions or suggestions?

I have no further questions.
